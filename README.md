# notion_api_client

*A Dart client for the Notion API.*

## Getting started

### Missing files

Add `example/credentials.dart` with:

```dart
const token = '...';
```

A token can be generated by creating an integration at [My integrations | Notion Developers](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations).

For [internal integrations](https://developers.notion.com/docs/getting-started#internal-notion-integrations), add the integration to its associated workspace:

- Click top right `"..."`
- Click `"Add Connections..."`
- Search for your Integration

> Internal Integrations only work for one workspace - to check which workspace an integration is for, under **Internal Integration Token** it says “Only works with the … workspace”

### Run the example

- Use VS Code launch config: "Notion Client [example]"
- Run: `dart run example/notion_api_client_example.dart`

## Usage

```dart
final aPageId = 'your_page_id_here';

void main() async {
  var client = NotionClient(token: token);

  try {
    var response =
        await client.getBlockChildren(id: aPageId);

    print(response);
  } on APIRequestException catch (error) {
    print(error.getJsonValue(key: 'message'));
  } finally {
    client.close();
  }
}
```

## Http Status Codes & Error Messages

From the [Notion Docs](https://developers.notion.com/reference/status-codes):

Responses from the API use HTTP response codes are used to indicate general classes of success and error.

Error responses contain more detail about the error in the response body, in the "code" and "message" properties.

- `api_client_utils`

  - When an API request receives something other than 200, an `ApiException` is thrown
  - We call `getJsonValue` with key 'message' on the `ApiException` to get the error message

## Features

### Scrape Notion Docs for API Description

#### Http Status Messages

Run `bin/scrape_docs.dart` with the "Docs Scraper" launch config

- Output: `output/api-description/http_status_messages.json`
